# GMIT Programming and Scipting Exercises
This respository is a place to share my GMIT excercises
## Weeks 1 and 2
fib.py contains my answers to the excercise for week 2.
Note that at the bottom of the script I have added my comments from the discussion forum (week 1 and week 2) as comments in the code
## Week 3
collatz.py contains my answer to the exercise for week 3.
Note that I initially did it with "n = 17" hard coded into the program, then I changed it to ask the user for an integer so it can be used for the general case.
Also I noticed that integer division resulted in floating point numbers - the printout looked a little strange to me so i rounded all the outputs (so there are no decimels)
## Week 5
euler5.py contains my solution to project euler problem 5.
Note I intitially completed this using a while loop and an if statement, I then reworked it in week 5 to include a for loop and a range statement as requested my Ian McLoughlin. The comments in the code should explain my algorithm.
## Week 6
openfile.py contains my solution to problem asking us to open the iris.csv file and then print out the values in a nice format. first i downloaded the csv file and saved in a data folder as Ian did in the video lecture. I then wrote the code to open the file and go though it line by line printing out the values to 1 place of decimel with 1 space between the columns. There are some comments in the code. I used the python tutorial as a refernece for this one to determine how to format floating point numbers. There was some trial and error but I got there!
