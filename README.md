# gmit-exercises
This respository is a place to share my GMIT excercises
# Weeks 1 and 2
fib.py contains my answers to the excercise for week 02
note than at the bottom of the script i have added my comments from the discussion forum (week 1 and week 2) for as comments in the code
# Week 3
collatz.py contains my answer to the exercise for week 3
note that i initially did it with "n = 17" hard coded into the program, then i changed it to ask the user for an integer so it can be used for the general case
Also i noticed that integer division resulted in floating point numbers - the printout looked a little strange to me so i rounded all the outputs (so there are no decimels)
